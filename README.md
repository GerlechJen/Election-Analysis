# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit 
Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis 
In this project, I was to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee in auditing the tabulated results for a recent Colorado local congressional election. I was tasked to: 
1. calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
The goal here is to automate the process using Python so that the code can be used to audit not only other congressional districts, but senatorial districts and local elections. We took into account three voting methods: Mail-In Ballot, Punch Cards and Direct Recording Electronic(DRE) counting machines. A vote count report will be generated after the analysis to certify the election results.
